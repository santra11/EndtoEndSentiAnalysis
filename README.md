# EndtoEndSentiAnalysis
In this project, I will use Deep Learning (Non-trained & Pretrained) models to study the sentiment analysis for a tweet dataset. For the Pretrained I will use the GloVe and the fast text embedding. I will also create a Deep learning model from scratch and compare the results. Then I will deply the model in to Microsoft Azure.
