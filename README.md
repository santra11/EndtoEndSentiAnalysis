# End to End Sentimental Analysis
In this project, 
* I will try the compare the sentiment labels of the tweet dataset with built in Azure API prediction.
* I will use Deep Learning models to study the sentiment analysis for a tweet dataset. For the Pretrained, I will use the GloVe and the fast text embedding. 
* I will also create a Deep learning model from scratch and compare the results. 
* Then I will deploy the (fastText) model in to Microsoft Azure.
